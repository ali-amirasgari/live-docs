Our project is a real-time collaborative document editor, similar to Google Docs, but with enhanced commenting and annotation features. It allows multiple users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents simultaneously, with a focus on seamless feedback and discussion within the document.

Key Features:
Real-time Editing â€“ Multiple users can work on the same document simultaneously with live updates.
Commenting System â€“ Users can leave comments on specific text selections, reply to comments, and resolve discussions.
Annotations & Highlights â€“ Highlight text and add inline annotations for better collaboration.
Version History â€“ Track changes, view past versions, and restore previous drafts.
Role-Based Permissions â€“ Control who can edit, comment, or view the document.
Rich Text Formatting â€“ Support for headings, bold, italics, lists, and more.
Cloud Storage & Sync â€“ Documents are saved automatically and accessible from any device.
Export & Sharing â€“ Download documents in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX) and share them via links.
This project is designed for teams, writers, and researchers who need a powerful yet intuitive way to collaborate on documents. ðŸš€
